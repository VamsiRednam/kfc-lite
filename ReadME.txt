 	I am talented and passionate frontend developer with a keen interest in website development. With a creative mindset and a strong attention to detail, Vamsi enjoys creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites that provide seamless experiences to users.

	This website appears to be an online ordering platform for KFC, a popular fast-food restaurant chain. The website allows customers to place their orders by selecting their desired meal and add-ons, providing their personal details, and reviewing the order summary before placing the final order.

The site features a visually appealing design with a prominent KFC banner at the top. It uses Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework, to enhance the styling and responsiveness of the web page.

The ordering process is divided into three sections represented as collapsible accordion items. The first section collects customer details such as name and mobile number. The second section allows customers to select their preferred meal from two options: OMG Burger and OMG Roller. The third section offers add-on options, including 8 Wing's Plate and 8 Wing's Bucket. Customers can select one or both add-ons.

Upon clicking the "Submit" button, a modal window appears displaying an order summary. The summary includes the customer's name, mobile number, selected meal, add-ons, and total amount. The modal also provides a "Place Order" button to finalize the order.

The website incorporates JavaScript functions to handle user interactions and form validation. For example, the `SubmitClick()` function calculates the meal and add-on costs based on the user's selections and updates the order summary accordingly. The `verifyName()` function validates the customer name field and displays an error message if it is left empty.

Overall, this website provides a user-friendly interface for customers to place their KFC orders online, offering a convenient and efficient way to enjoy their favorite KFC meals.
